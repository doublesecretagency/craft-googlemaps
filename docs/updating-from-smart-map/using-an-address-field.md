# 🔧 Using an Address field

<update-message/>

**The internal Address field has been improved significantly!** It is now far more powerful and flexible than it was previously in Smart Map. To see how it works now, check out this [animated GIF...](/address-field/)

Within your Twig templates, an Address field will return a complete [Address Model](/models/address-model/). It's important to remember that an Address Model is an extension of the [Location Model](/models/location-model/), which means you can use all the features described in both models.

To get an idea of what is possible, read more about [using an Address in Twig](/address-field/in-twig/).
