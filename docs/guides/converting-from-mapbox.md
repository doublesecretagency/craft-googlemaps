# Converting from Mapbox

## Importing Address Data

Converting from an "Address (Mapbox)" field to an "Address (Google Maps)" field is relatively straightforward... simply **switch the field type** on the field's settings page.

<img class="dropshadow" :src="$withBase('/images/guides/switch-field-type.png')" alt="Screenshot of field type select being switched to Address (Google Maps)" width="210" style="margin-left:20px; margin-bottom:4px;">

Once you have saved the field as an "Address (Google Maps)" field, all data associated with that field will automatically be imported into the Google Maps plugin.

### One Field at a Time

When you update a single field, only the data for that specific field will be converted. Each Address field will need to be updated individually.

:::tip Field Configuration Not Included
The field's **settings** will not be ported, only the field's existing **data** will be transferred over.

You may still want to configure the Google Maps field to your liking, it will not automatically reflect how you had it configured with Mapbox.

### Deploying to Production

When deploying to a production environment, you'll most likely be using [Project Config](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/project-config.html) to keep all of your configuration settings in sync. Don't worry, there will be little (or no) action required on your part.

All relevant Address data will be converted **once your Project Config changes are applied**.
